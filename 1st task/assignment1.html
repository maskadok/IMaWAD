    <p>Hello to everyone who sees this!<br>My name is above and I am 19, my hometown is Balkhash.<br>
        Studying IT Management in KBTU <i class="fa-solid fa-building-columns"></i>

    <p>For the whole life if someone starts talking about hobbies, the first thing comes to my mind is Speedcubing - ability to quickly solve different Rubik's Cubes. The first cube I ever solved was way back in 2017 I think, that was something. And then I went all in - I couldn't stop solving and buying new cubes, nowadays I've like 40 of these thingies. From 2018 till 2021 I was even going to National Rubik's Cube competitions to Aktobe, Almaty, Astana, Semey, Karaganda and so on. The photos you see are made by me in 2018, and are not even half of my collection. All other photos are me goofing around with shaping some silly pictures out of cubes. I love doing it to this day but not as fired up about it as when I was a kid.

        The second hobby of mine is cooking. I love cooking some masterpieces (they're not for sure) with my girlfriend, who actually taught me. Besides, I absolutely love seasonings! They can completely change the flavour and I'm addicted to some of them. I like to choose seasonings so that they harmoniously complement the ingredients and give the dish a unique flavour.
