Instructions: Download everything, open html file, click the "Roll Dice" button. If you roll doubles, you won.
Additional Features: Animation (dice rotate when you roll them to simulate a realistic rolling effect)
If the sum of the dice equals 12 (6 and 6) more special message will appear, because it is a jackpot :)
